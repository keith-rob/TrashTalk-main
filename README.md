TrashTalk is a simple chat app that allows a user to create a private room and share a unique room code with their friends, who can then use that code to join the chat room. When the app starts, it will use the device’s geolocation features to record the user’s current position. Once other users have joined the chat room, the app will then calculate the distance in miles (or feet, if the distance is less than one mile) between the user and their friends in the chat room. When a user creates a new account, they will be asked for their name. The name they provide is then sent to a Wikimedia API to pull back a random image that contains the provided name. That image is then set as the user’s avatar.
